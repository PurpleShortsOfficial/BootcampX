# Evaluation Pattern

Candidates will be evaluated on the basis of the following components —

| Component             | Points         | Frequency                  | Type       |
| --------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Minor Assignments** | 10 points each | About 3 assignments / Week | Individual |
| **Major Assignments** | 50 points each | 1 / Module                 | Individual |
| **Final Project**     | 100 points     | 1                          | Group      |

The cumulative score of these will decide their final competence level gained from the bootcamp/internship.

| Competence Level  | Score Range  |
